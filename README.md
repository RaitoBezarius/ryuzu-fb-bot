# RyuZU AI — Facebook Bot

Well, did my best to *not write this code*.

Unfortunately, a RyuZU AI is too much appealing.

So here we go!

# Installation

Well, your usual lingo, `pip` / make your virtualenv and deploy it.

# Configuration

You can override all config of `.env.template.template` using environment variables.

Otherwise, you have to set application-dependent stuff (tokens & API).

As a matter of fact, this code makes no assumption on SSL.
IMHO, this should be left for NGINX / your webserver.
